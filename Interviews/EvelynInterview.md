[Speaker 1]     
 Can you tell me about any difficulties you faced when trying to make new friends at UQ?         
 [Speaker 2]        
  One challenge I faced when making new friends was the cultural and language differences. UQ has such a large international student population, which has a great diversity, but it also means people have very different communication styles, slang, and humour. , As someone new to the school and whose first language isn’t English, it was sometimes hard to keep up in fast-paced conversations. The slang and expressions were all new to me, so I had to slowly adjust and learn as I went.

   That’s all for my interview, thank you for your time ​​Interview 2

 Have you ever faced any difficulties when making new friends at UQ? 
 [Speaker 2]        
  Yes, especially when I first entered the school, everyone seemed to have their own circle and its hard to bond with them.
