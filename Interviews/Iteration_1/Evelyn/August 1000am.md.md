Speaker 1:     
Hi, I'm doing an interview. May I have your concern to record this interview?       
Speaker 2:     
Okay.      
Speaker 1:     
so how do you feel about UQ? It's nice. The camp is very big and I found the students and lecturers here are lofly and some of them just very helpful. And also I just found the facilities here, numerous.       
Speaker 1:        
 Okay. How do you think about your friends, like, your connection with them?       


 Speaker 1:       
 How do I think might think my friend? I don't have a friend. I'm just   kidding. So, I mean, I do make some of friends, like in. They are nice and they are friendly. When I got some, maybe the language barrier, they will help me to maybe just to simplify the sentence and let me understand.     
  Speaker 2:       
  Oh, how do you your friend? in class. We got the same lesson. That's the same session time. Okay.
 
Speaker 1:    
Do you think that the lecturer class is the duration is long enough for you to formulate friendship?


Speaker 2:
Uh, yes. I mean, uh, the classation is around like two to three hours and we kind of like always focus on the lecture or the lesson. So you can like maybe chat with people sitting around you and if you, like you have got Sam interest, then you can make friends and talk to each other.


Speaker 1:     
Okay. You mentioned about common interests, right? In your opinion, how do you feel, like, what's the role of common interest takes place in friendship?
Speaker 2:
It's like a major role. Yeah. Yeah, if you got a common topics, it's much easier for you to... have more conversations.       
Speaker 1:    
Okay. Are you from here?
Speaker 2:
Am I from here? Like, am I from Australia? No, I'm not local.


Speaker 1:     
How do you think like culture or language barrier makes it connect with others?       
Speaker 1:    
How do I think? I mean, uh culture is not not a big issue to make friends. It's just we are from different cultural backgrounds. We need to learn from each other, we need to respect each other and also we got language barrier, if we try to understand or try to know a new languageages, like new language, it's much fun. Okay.     
Speaker 1:    
Can you describe any situation where you find it difficult to connect with others?    
Speaker 2:    
 Maybe Yeah, I mean, I mean, not talk about like in Australia, I mean, talk about the experience in Malaysia. Yeah, when I first traveled to Malaysia, my friend is Malaysian and they speak Malay, Mandarin and English. When they' speaking Malay, I have no idea about this language. I'm like, it's like a third word language. I can't understand. But even though, like in Malaysia, most of people, they speak Malay, but if you separate the words, actually you can understand it and your friend also will help you translate the Malay to maybe Chinese, maybe English.        
 Speaker 1:    
 Okay. Yeah.. Okay, so that's all for my interview. Thank you for your time. Okay. Okay.
