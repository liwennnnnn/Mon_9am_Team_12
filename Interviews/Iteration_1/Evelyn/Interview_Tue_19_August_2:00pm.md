Speaker 1:     
Hello can i conduct an interview for my assignment?

Speaker 1:     
Can I record the interview?    
Speaker 2:     
Yes    
Speaker 1:      
Do you have any close friends in UQ?       
Speaker 2:     
Yes I do. We met through same club and society.    
Speaker 1:         
Oh great! What role do common interests play in your friendships, and how do you usually bond over them?       
Speaker 2:     
I think this is the key for us to keep our conversation going, as we have the same interest, so thereâ€™s many things to talk about.     
Speaker 1:     
Could you share an example where you struggled (or succeeded) in finding people with similar interests?    
Speaker 2:          
I struggled a lot when I tried to find people that has similar interests as I do, as I first approached to people and talk to them on my interest, some of them seemed uninterested. As someone who has social anxiety felt a bit awkward and uncomfortable to do so.      
Speaker 1:     
How easy is it for you to find someone who has the same interest as you?       
Speaker 2:     
I personally think it is pretty hard for me to do so, as I have encountered many different people, and everyone has different personalities, I have to bet whether he has the same hobby as I do.
