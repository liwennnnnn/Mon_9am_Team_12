Excuse me, I will record this interview. Is that okay?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
I just ask some quick questions for our project. This interview is only for learning process. Okay.

Can you tell me about any difficulties you faced when trying to make new friends at UQ?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, so one problem I often faced when trying to make new friends is figuring out how to keep the conversation flowing naturally. I sometimes struggling with finding common interests, especially when I don't know much about the other person yet. It can make it hard to move past small talk and build a real connection.

[Speaker 2]
Thank you.
