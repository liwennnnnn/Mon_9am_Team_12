**Interview 2**    
Speaker 1:     
Hello can i conduct an interview for my assignment?       
Speaker 2:     
Yes    
Speaker 1:     
Do you make friends easily when you first joined UQ    
Speaker 2:     
I think it was pretty hard, everyone seemed to already have their groups, you know? Like, I'd walk into lectures and see people chatting with their friends, and I'm just sitting there alone. I'm quite shy, so I found it really intimidating to just randomly start conversations with strangers.            
Speaker 1:             
Ohh I see , then do you think there Is enough time during lectures to have conversations that's deep enough in order to establish friendship with classmates?            
Speaker 2:     
I personally don’t think so because most of my classmates are just Hi Bye, because we didn’t have enough time to have meaningful conversations during lecture class. Plus in the next class, the person that sits beside me wouldn’t be the same with the one who sat with me last week.       
Speaker 1:     
Can you describe a situation where a cultural or language barrier made it difficult to connect with people in school?      
Speaker 2:     
Yes, I could. As an international student, starting a conversation with local is quite hard. Although I can speak fluent English, but I noticed that the local tends to mix better to local. So every time I tried to talk to a local and another local join, they automatically starts their own conversation and I would be left out, not being able to join their conversation. I believe its culture difference.       
Speaker 1:             
Other than lecture class, do you think there is any other way to make friends and do you find it easy to learn about these opportunities at UQ?    
Speaker 2:     
Hmmm I think there are two ways, the first one is tutorial, where the all the student are permanently there, and we will be sitting on the same table every week, so I personally think it is easy to have friendship developed there, Second way is probably club and societies, where we share the same interest together, and it is easy to start a topic conversation there.
