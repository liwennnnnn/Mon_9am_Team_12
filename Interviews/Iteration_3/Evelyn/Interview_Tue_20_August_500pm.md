**Interview 3**    
Speaker 1:     
Hello, can I conduct an interview for my assignment?       
Speaker 2:     
Yeah, sure.    
Speaker 1:     
Can I record the interview?           
Speaker 2 :    
Yeah.          
Speaker 1:     
Alright, so first question is how easily or difficult do you find it to make new friends during lectures or tutorial in UQ?       
Speaker 2      
I think it's pretty easy to make new friends during class times, especially during the tuts as normally it will be assigned into groups and this is when you get a chance to make new friends.     
Speaker 1:     
Oh, I see. What's the biggest challenge in your friends when you're trying to make new friends in electrical class?        
Speaker 2:     
I guess the biggest challenge is most of the people that do not really attend their eleectual class that often That means if I really want to try to make new friends during the first lecture class, I might not see them anymore in the future .     
Speaker 1:     
So what are the strategies you used to build and maintain, you know friendship with these people?      
Speaker 2:         
Not strategies, perhaps just a quick catch up with them        
Speaker 1:     
Yeah do you think culture or language barrier make it difficult to connect with others     
Speaker 2:     
It can be difficult, but I think it depends on if you really want to make new friends, I don't think this could be a barrier.      
Speaker 1:     
Oh, okay, so the last question is, can you describe a situation where a cultural or language barrier made it difficult to connect with people in school?       
Speaker 2:     
For example, when I just came to UQ, I found it's hard to catch why the locus stayed as I'm not used to them and also their talking speed. Alright, that's all that's all for my interview, so thank you for your time. No worries.
