Speaker 1:     
Hi, I will become ding an interview May I have your concern to record this interview       
Speaker 2:     
Yes    
Speaker 1:     
Okay, how do you feel about UQ? I like UQ. I think that's a good community and I like the courses and degree options they have. How about your friends? Like, how is your connection with them?     
Speaker 2:     
Yeah, I like my friends, I think I have like a lot of friends from high school that I kind of stuck with and I think it's been good to make new friends that orientation at UQ.        
Speaker 1:     
Oh, okay, great. And can you share how your mate these friends in YQ?
Speaker 2:     
Yeah, I made friends at UQ through mainly like orientation activities and if not orientation activities, then like classwork or like assignments, certain in groups.       
Speaker 1:     
I see.Do you think lecture class like the duration is it long enough to formulate friendship?      
Speaker 2:     
I think. I think, like the length of the lectures is okay, but I think the lectures are like a hard place to make friends because you can't really talk much in the lectures, so you kind of just sit there and silence.       
Speaker 1:     
Yeah, I agree. what is your biggest challenge you face when you trying to approach and make friends in the lecture?    
Speaker 2:     
I think the main issue with making friends in the lecture is that there's not really much you can talk about and that the lecture environment is usually quite quiet and there's not many group activities in the lecture. So they like the lecturer kind of just talks to you and you have to sit there quietly, so you can't talk to the people beside you much. I agree.       
Speaker 1:     
Um, are you from here?     
Speaker 2:     
Yeah, I'm domestic student.        
Speaker 1:     
Oh, okay.      
Speaker 1:     
Um. Do you feel cool to approach? Maybe you students from different cultures and backgrounds?      
Speaker 1:     
Yeah, yeah, I'm happy for that.        
Speaker 1:     
All right, so, in your opinion, what role do common interest play in your friendship and how do you usually bond over them?    
Speaker 2:     
I think common interests are important. I think, like different interests are also okay, but I think, yeah, friendship probably clicks more when you have common interests.       
Speaker 1:     
How hard is it for you to find someone to have the same interest as you?
Speaker 2:     
Hmm I think it's pretty easy. I mean, like, I don't know, I feel like, like, teenagers kind of have, like, overall roughly the same interests, but, yeah, if you. are in, like, a course that you both enjoy, I think it's easier to have common interests with the people that you're talking to.        
Speaker 1:     
All right. All right. That's all for my interview. Thank you for your time.
