SPEAKER_01:
 Hello, I'm doing a small student project about peer network. Could I record our conversation?


SPEAKER_01:
 And it's just for study purpose and will be kept private.


SPEAKER_00:
 Yes, no problem.


SPEAKER_01:
 Thank you. And there are no last or wrong answers. Just share your experiences.

SPEAKER_01:
 And the first question is, do you think language barriers make it harder to connect with other students?


SPEAKER_00:
 Yeah, I think the language barrier will be harder to connect each other, especially for someone who also not speaking English as a first language.


SPEAKER_01:
 Okay, and the second question is, do you feel comfortable approaching students from different cultural backgrounds?


SPEAKER_00:
 Yeah, I'm happy to get in touch with different people and knowing their cultural background. Just make some friends. As long as they are nice, then that will be no problem.

SPEAKER_01:
 Thank you. And the last question is, do you think language barriers make it harder to connect with other students?


SPEAKER_00:
 Yeah, I'm happy to get in touch with different people and knowing their cultural background.


SPEAKER_01:
 Thank you. And the second question is, do you feel comfortable approaching students from different cultural backgrounds?


SPEAKER_00:
 Yeah, I think the main question is do you feel this group provides enough support for students from different backgrounds?


SPEAKER_01:
 Yeah, I'm happy to get in touch with different people and knowing their cultural background.


SPEAKER_00:
 And do you feel this group provides enough support for students from different backgrounds?


SPEAKER_00:
 And do you feel this group provides enough support for students from different backgrounds?


SPEAKER_00:
 I think the school is doing a good job, the door is already open for the student, but as I know many students are afraid to ask questions, so they just like stepping back by themselves which is really really helpful to them.


SPEAKER_00:
 So just go ahead, ask questions, solve the problem.


SPEAKER_00:
 That's the university you have to make a responsibility for yourself.


SPEAKER_01:
 Thanks a lot for your time and your input. It's really helpful for our project.


SPEAKER_01:
 Also, the recording will be kept confidential and used only for study purpose.

SPEAKER_01:
 Have a nice day. Thank you.
