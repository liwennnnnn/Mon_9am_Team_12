SPEAKER_00:
 I am doing a small student project about peer network. Can I record our conversation?
SPEAKER_00:
 Okay. It's just for research and it will be private. 
SPEAKER_01:   okay
SPEAKER_00:
 and then the first question is, do you think language barriers make it harder to connect with other students?


SPEAKER_01:
 Yes, because I think, because I am from China, so when I first come here, the English is my barrier to communicate with others.


SPEAKER_00:
 Okay, and the second question is, how often do you participate in group activities with students from other cultural backgrounds? Maybe just as classes like tutorials, I can chat with them.

SPEAKER_00:
 Do you prefer working with students who share your language or culture? 
SPEAKER_01:   Pardon? 
PEAKER_00:     Do you prefer working with students who share your language or culture?

SPEAKER_01:
 Yes, because I think we have more topic to communicate.


SPEAKER_00:
 Thank you. Thank you for your time and the conversation.

SPEAKER_00:
 It's just for studying. Have a nice day.


SPEAKER_00:
 Okay.
