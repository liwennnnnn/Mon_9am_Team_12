SPEAKER_00:
 Hello, I'm doing a small student project. Could I record our conversation?


SPEAKER_00:
 Yes. It's just for study purpose and it will keep priority.


SPEAKER_00:
 The first question is, what challenges have you faced when trying to participate in group activities or discussions?


SPEAKER_00:
 I find it difficult to keep up with their English, especially when speaking with someone with an accent. I get disconnected easily from the conversation.


SPEAKER_00:
 Do you think language barriers make it harder to connect with others?


SPEAKER_00:
 Yes, because sometimes language barriers can cause misunderstandings.


SPEAKER_00:
 OK. The last question.


SPEAKER_00:
 How do you usually approach meeting new classmates from different cultural backgrounds?


SPEAKER_00:
 I will meet new classmates from different cultural backgrounds through some social activities and community activities organized by the school.


SPEAKER_00:
 Thank you. Have a nice day.
