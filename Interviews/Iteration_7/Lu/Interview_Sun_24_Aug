SPEAKER_01:
 Hello, I'm doing a small student project about Pure Network. Can I record our conversation? And it's just for study purpose.


SPEAKER_00:
 Oh, sure. You can start now.


SPEAKER_01:
 Okay, the first question is, what changes have you faced while trying to participate in group activities or discussions?


SPEAKER_00:
 Honestly, recently, people seem quieter than before. Phones grab so much attention. So you have to be more proactive to pull others into the discussion.


SPEAKER_00:
 I think and I feel everyone. I feel like everyone has lots of opinions. But sometimes they're afraid of saying that the wrong thing. So they just stay silent.


SPEAKER_01:
 Okay, the second question is, in your opinion, what would make it easier for students from different backgrounds to feel part of the school community?


SPEAKER_00:
 Maybe more casual events.


SPEAKER_00:
 Like festival or game nights where people can share their culture without pressure. Like this.


SPEAKER_01:
 Thank you. The last question is, do you feel the school provides enough support for students from diverse backgrounds?


SPEAKER_00:
 Actually, to be honest, the school tries. But sometimes the support feels like more formality than the actual support.


SPEAKER_00:
 So I think that's something real. I think there are resources, but not everyone knows how to assess them like this.

SPEAKER_01:
 Thank you. Your input is really helpful for our project. Have a nice day.
