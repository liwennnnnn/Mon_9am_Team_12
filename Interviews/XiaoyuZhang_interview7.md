[Speaker1]: How do you usually try to identify whether someone shares your interests?
[Speaker2]: Uh, I think it's a bit of hard because sometimes I just share my own interests first and see if they respond with the same enthusiasm.
[Speaker1]: Do you think having common interests is essential for building strong friendships? Why or why not?
[Speaker2]: Uh, not always. Because I have a lot of friends who don't share the same interests as me since one of my friends, uh, but we connect through values and understanding.
