Interview 1
-I'm doing a short interview for university projects. Can I ask you two quick questions? 
-Yes.  
-Would it be okay if I record it? 
-Okay.  
-Let's begin with the first question. The first question is, do you face any difficulties when making new friends at UQ?
-Yes, I don't know where to find new friends and sometimes, for example, when we have a class, I'm too shy to talk to other classmates. 
-Thank you. The second question is, can you tell me about any difficulties you faced when trying to make new friends at UQ? 
-The first one is that I'm not familiar with this environment and I'm still trying to talk to them. I don't know what to talk. Secondly, my English is not very good, so sometimes I can't understand them and I can't express myself clearly. 
-Ok, thank you for your words


Interview 2

-Ok.
-Would it be okay if I record it? 
-Ok.
-Ok. Thank you. The question is, can you tell me about any difficulties you faced when trying to make new friends at UQ?  
-I think many students have their friend groups that makes it a difficult to fit in them. What's more, I have different classmates in different classes. I don't have enough time to develop friendship. 
-Thank you for your interview
